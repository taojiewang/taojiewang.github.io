How do we explain actions out of love for one’s dead beloved? Contemporary theories of love that adopt the approach of identifying the practical reason love gives us have a difficult time offering a satisfactory explanation. According to the benevolence theorist, love essentially consists in the lover caring for the well-being or
happiness of the beloved for the beloved’s own sake. Yet, they have a hard time
establishing that the dead beloved has any well-being or one that can be promoted
or harmed. According to the ends-sharing theorist, love consists in sharing in the
beloved’s pursuit of ends or projects that are significant. But they fail to account
for cases where we defy the beloved’s death wish out of love.

<p>
In this paper, I argue that acting out of love for one’s dead beloved or more
generally, love in the absence of the other, motivate an account of love which looks
beyond the popular contemporary approach. More specifically, I propose that part
of what loving someone consists in is taking a particular stance towards them,
where taking such a stance consists in sharing with the beloved certain agent-attitudes or dispositions to take such agent-attitudes in appropriate context. Therefore,
it is not because we want to promote the well-being of our dead beloved or other
but because we share with them this stance that we act after they die.

  abstract={What does it take for a desire to be intelligible? This paper proposes an answer to this question. I argue, first, that we should reject the dominant approach in the literature, according to which the intelligibility of desire consists in the object of the desire possessing some desirable quality; and the job of an account of the intelligibility of desire is to identify what such quality is. I show that two accounts representative of this approach are unsatisfactory, because they struggle to explain cases in which personal idiosyncrasies play a role in determining what is or is not intelligible to someone. The reason for this, I argue, is that the dominant approach neglects the interpersonality that is intrinsic to the intelligibility of desire. Alternatively, I propose that the intelligibility of desire consists in the desire being shared by the desirer to whom the intelligibility is in question. }
